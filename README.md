## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run this project on your local machine.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating the Virtual Environment

To keep dependencies well-organized and avoid conflicts with other projects, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. Here's how you can create one:

**Linux/macOS**:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

**Windows**:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Activating the Virtual Environment

Once created, you need to activate the virtual environment:

**Linux/macOS**:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows** (cmd.exe):

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìö Main Libraries

- **Numpy**: It is the fundamental library for scientific computing with Python. It offers a powerful array of objects and tools to work with these arrays.
- **Pandas**: Provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data easy and intuitive.
- **Matplotlib**: It is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: Based on Matplotlib, Seaborn helps to create more attractive and informative statistical visualizations.
